    <string name="backup_instructions">Iuvo can save or restore your degree plan by using a backup located on your SD card. Please be sure to have an external (or \"internal\") SD card installed!\n\nThe backup file is named \"IuvoDatabase.db\" and can be found at \"[SD card]/Iuvo\". Iuvo will only save to or restore from this file only.\n\nFor the geeks that are wondering: Yes, this backup is indeed viewable in any SQLite viewer.</string>

    <!-- Semesters Help -->
    <string name="semester_help_title">\"When did I take that class again?\"</string>
    <string name="semester_help_overview">Iuvo allows you to create semesters in order to match your college career path as closely as possible. You can name your semesters anything you want. \"Fall 2011\", \"May Minimester 2012\" or \"Greatest Semester Ever!\" are all fine!	\n\n
        In addition, you can pick a color for your semester. Classes assigned to a semester will be displayed in that semester\’s color on your degree plan.\n\n
		Tip: If you don’t want your degree plan to look too colorful, you can assign a single color to many semesters to indicate that they are completed, that you really liked those semesters, or for any other reason you want.</string>
    <string name="semester_help_add">Add a semester from the menu at the top. Enter the name, select a color, and then save. Easy peasy.</string>
    <string name="semester_help_delete">Delete a semester by swiping left or right. Courses assigned to that semester will have no semester assigned to them.</string>
    <string name="semester_help_arrange">Re-arrange your semesters by dragging their handles on the right side. This doesn\’t affect anything else, it simply helps organize your semesters.</string>
    <string name="semester_help_edit">Edit a semester name or color by tapping on it.</string>
    
    <!-- Groups Help -->
    <string name="group_help_title">Not all degree plans are the same</string>
    <string name="group_help_overview">Some degree plans will categorize your classes by subject, such as Math, Science, English, etc. Others will categorize them by year: Freshman, Junior, etc. Iuvo allows you to create groups in order to match your degree plan as closely as possible.</string>
    <string name="group_help_add">Add a group from the menu at the top. Enter the name and then save. Easy peasy.</string>
    <string name="group_help_delete">Delete a group by swiping left or right. Courses assigned to that group will be hidden from your degree plan.</string>

    <string name="course_help_title">Are you a student? Because you must have class.</string>
	<string name="course_help_name">Adding courses to your degree plan is easy. Start off with the name. Call it whatever you want. \"ENGR 123\", \"Calculus II\" or \"[Professor name] sucks!\" are all perfectly acceptable.</string>
    <string name="course_help_credit">Next up are credit hours and grade. Iuvo should cover all of the possible values for U.S. post-secondary courses. If not, then let the developer know so that it can be included in an update.</string>
    <string name="course_help_exclude">Some institutions do not include transfer credit in your GPA calculation. If you don’t want Iuvo to include a course in your GPA calculations, just let it know.</string>
    <string name="course_help_group">Assign group that you created to your course. Your course will appear under that group in your degree plan. Courses that do not have a group assigned to them will be hidden from your degree plan. You can edit your hidden courses in the ‘more’ tab of the home screen.</string>
    <string name="course_help_semester">Finally, assign a semester that you created to your course. Your course will appear in your degree plan while rockin’ that semester’s color.</string>
