    <!-- Get Started Page -->
    <string name="title_activity_start_help">Getting Started</string>
    <string name="plan_getting_started_header">Welcome to your degree plan.</string>
    <string name="plan_getting_started_note1">Let\'s face it, placing your entire college or university degree plan into an app probably won\'t be the fastest thing you\'ll ever do, but Iuvo\'s simple interface should make it as quick and easy as possible. With a good amount of effort, we should have a beautiful, flexible, and detailed degree plan set up in no time. Iuvo can then give you statistics about your college career and will continue to do so even as you make chagnes later on.</string>
    <string name="plan_getting_started_note1_1"><i>Tip: You should back up your degree plan in the \'more\' tab afterwards so that you don\'t lose all of your hard earned work.</i></string>
    <string name="plan_getting_started_note2">First, start off by adding semesters. These aren\'t needed to construct your degree plan, but Iuvo uses your semesters to help \'color-code\' your courses, making it easier to recognize when you took them. If you need help while adding or managing your semesters, hit the \'help\' button that displays at the top of the semesters screen.</string>
    <string name="plan_getting_started_note3">Next, we\'ll add groups. Groups are the basic building block of your degree plan in Iuvo and are used to organize your courses the same that way your actual degree plan does. The courses that you create in the next step will appear under these groups. Without groups, none of your courses will be able to appear on your degree plan at all. If still need help with understanding and using groups, hit the \'help\' button that displays at the top of the groups screen. Once you add your first group, this tutorial will disappear and your degree plan will take its place. You can view this tutorial in the \'more\' tab if you need to read it again.</string>
    <string name="plan_getting_started_note4">Finally, we\'ll complete your degree plan in Iuvo by adding every single course from your curriculum. Courses contain a lot more information than semesters or groups, and are therefore explained in more detail through the \'help\' button in the course screen. You should read this so that you can add all of your courses properly, including transfer credit and credit that is not part of your degree plan. Adding your courses is the final step. Once you\'re done, Iuvo will be able to give you detailed breakdowns about your GPA, grade distribution, and other information in the \'me\' tab.</string>
    <string name="plan_getting_started_note5">Below is a small sample of what your degree plan should look like. It includes a two semesters, two groups, and three courses. Remember, this tutorial will disappear after adding your first group. You can always view it in the \'more\' tab if you need to read it again.</string>

    <!-- Semesters Help Activity -->

    <string name="semester_help_title">\"When did I take that class again?\"</string>
    <string name="semester_help_overview">Iuvo allows you to create semesters in order to match your college career path as closely as possible.\n\n
        Unlike groups, semesters are NOT a fundamental building block of your degree plan. You can construct your entire degree plan without adding a single semester, but using semesters will give your degree plan a more complete and detailed appearance.\n\n
        You\'re allowed to name your semesters anything you want. \"Fall 2011\", \"May Minimester 2012\" or \"Greatest Semester Ever!\" are all fine. In addition, you can pick a color for your semester. Classes assigned to a semester will be displayed in that semester\'s color on your degree plan.\n\n
		Tip: If you don’t want your degree plan to look too colorful, you can assign a single color to many semesters to indicate that they are completed.</string>
    <string name="semester_help_add">Add a semester from the menu at the top. Enter the name, select a color, and then save.</string>
    <string name="semester_help_delete">Delete a semester by swiping left or right. Courses assigned to that semester will have no semester assigned to them.</string>
    <string name="semester_help_arrange">Re-arrange your semesters by dragging their handles on the right side. This doesn\’t affect anything else, it simply helps organize your semesters.</string>
    <string name="semester_help_edit">You can either view the courses under a semester or edit a semester by tapping on it.</string>

    <!-- Groups Help Activity -->
    <string name="title_activity_groups_help">Groups Help</string>
    <string name="group_help_title">Not all degree plans are the same</string>
    <string name="group_help_overview">Some degree plans will categorize your courses by subject, such as Math, Science, English, etc. Others will categorize them by year: Freshman, Junior, etc. Iuvo allows you to create groups in order to match your degree plan as closely as possible.\n\n
        The purpose of groups is to help Iuvo organize your courses the same way that your degree plan does. Groups are the basic building blocks of your degree plan and are needed to display your courses in an organized manner. You create your groups first, so that whenever you add a course, you can assign it to a group that you created. Your course then appears on your degree plan under that group.\n</string>
    <string name="group_help_add">Add a group from the menu at the top. Enter the name and then save.</string>
    <string name="group_help_delete">Delete a group by swiping left or right. Courses assigned to that group will be hidden from your degree plan. You can view your hidden courses in the \'more\' tab of the home screen.</string>
    <string name="group_help_arrange">Re-arrange your groups by dragging their handles on the right side. This affects the order of how your groups appear on your degree plan.</string>

    <!-- Course Help Activity -->
    <string name="title_activity_course_help">Course Help</string>

    <string name="course_help_title">Are you a student? Because you must have class.</string>
    <string name="course_help_name">Adding courses to your degree plan is easy. Start off with the name. Call it whatever you want. \"ENGR 123\", \"Calculus II\" or \"I hate [Professor name]!\" are all perfectly acceptable. If you\'re adding a course that has a name with more than one word, such as \"MATH 101\", Iuvo will retain the first word for the next entry, so that you can keep adding math courses without having to repetitively type \"MATH\" every time.</string>
    <string name="course_help_credit">Next up are credit hours and grade. Iuvo should cover all of the possible values for U.S. post-secondary courses. If not, then let the developer know so that it can be included in an update. Some international institutions use grades such as \'O\', \'T\', or \'AA\'. For those, please consider using \'A+\'.\n\n
        Tip: You can edit the GPA point value of your grades in the \'more\' tab of the home screen.</string>
    <string name="course_help_exclude">Some institutions do not include transfer credit in your GPA calculation. If you don’t want Iuvo to include a course in your GPA calculations, just let it know.</string>
    <string name="course_help_group">Assign a group that you created to your course. Your course will appear under that group in your degree plan. Courses that do not have a group assigned to them will be hidden from your degree plan. You can edit your hidden courses in the ‘more’ tab of the home screen.</string>
    <string name="course_help_semester">Finally, assign a semester that you created to your course. Your course will appear in your degree plan while rockin’ that semester’s color.</string>

    <string name="courses_help_arrange">If you\'re viewing your courses within a group, you can re-arrange your courses by dragging their handles on the right side. Your courses will appear in the same order within its assigned group on your degree plan.\n\n If you\'re viewing your courses within a semester, you cannot re-arrange your courses.
